# Building My Portfolio Site

Today I completed the first major version of my professional portfolio site, hosted on GitHub Pages using Jekyll.

---

## ðŸ›  What I Accomplished

- Set up Ruby, Bundler, and Jekyll on my local machine
- Scaffolded a clean new Jekyll project (no template, fully manual)
- Created a GitHub Pages repository with a custom domain: `solomon-smith-dev.tech`
- Structured the site properly with:
  - Home (`index.md`)
  - About page
  - Projects page
  - Blog page
- Set up a clean, working navigation bar
- Added a first real blog post
- Installed plugins for SEO, feed, and sitemap
- Fixed GitHub Pages build issues
- Correctly configured the custom domain with CNAME
- Fixed Minima theme rendering issues (author object bug)

---

## ðŸ§  Skills I Practiced Today

- Git basics and branching
- GitHub Pages deployment workflow
- YAML configuration in Jekyll
- SEO optimization for personal websites
- Debugging front-end theming issues
- Terminal basics (file creation, folder structuring)
- Clean Git commit practices

---

## ðŸ§± Obstacles I Overcame

- Jekyll installation issues
- Git push errors (wrong branch, wrong remote origin)
- GitHub Pages custom domain conflict (archived old repo)
- Footer rendering bug caused by Minima theme's author handling
- Cleaning up object rendering issues in site layouts

---

## ðŸš€ What's Next

- Add more blog posts and document future projects
- Polish the Projects page with more detailed case studies
- (Optional) Upgrade to Minimal Mistakes theme for a sleeker design
- Set up OpenGraph and social media meta tags
- Add downloadable resume and contact form

**First big sprint done. Site is live, clean, and professional. More to come.** ðŸ”¥
