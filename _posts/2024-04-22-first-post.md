Today I finished building my first personal portfolio site, hosted on GitHub Pages using Jekyll.

I learned:
- How to set up Ruby, Bundler, and Jekyll locally
- How to scaffold a new Jekyll site and customize it
- How to configure GitHub Pages with a custom domain
- How to organize real project pages and a blog

This is just the beginning â€” I'll be adding new projects, blog posts, and features over time.

Stay tuned!
