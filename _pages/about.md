# About Me

Hi, I'm Solomon Smith — a Computer Science student at CSU San Bernardino passionate about building intelligent systems that blend artificial intelligence, machine learning, and full-stack development.

Before pursuing tech, I spent over a decade working in the culinary industry, where I learned the importance of precision, creativity, and hard work — skills that I now apply to software engineering.

I am currently focused on:
- AI/ML model development (NLP, image classification)
- Backend engineering (Python, C++, FastAPI)
- Full-stack applications (React, MongoDB)

I am committed to using technology to solve real-world problems and contribute to more inclusive, ethical tech spaces.

# Current Goals

- Secure a Software Engineering or AI/ML internship for 2025
- Build open-source projects that blend AI, automation, and real-world utility
- Continuously grow as a backend engineer and machine learning practitioner
